      This recipe is from my dad and they are a favorite among friends and family.
      The secret ingredient is the coconut! <em>Be warned</em>, these will fly off of the plate!

      Baked biscuits have existed for all of recorded history. But, cookies as we know them today originated in medieval Persia. Even then, they were not as sweet as their modern counterparts. It wasn't until the 17th century that the Dutch brought what they called the "koekje" to New Amsterdam (modern day New York). From there, they became a staple of North American diet.

      Whenever I go to Europe, my friends want me to make chocolate chip cookies like we do here in the US. It isn't always easy because they usually have gas ovens and there's usually a change in altitude. But I can talk about that in another entry.
