#### _Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe, 3.19.20_

#### By _**Thomas Glenn**_

## Description

According to Ellen K. Lehman (github.com/ellenklehman), this is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe in the world! It includes the ingredients and directions for creating these world famous cookies as well as one little illustration of a cookie, (care of me). Though I haven't used this recipe, I'm drawn to the inclusion of coconut and oatmeal in my cookies because I hate overly soft and goey cookies. I much prefer a hard, biscuit-type cookie, bordering on biscotti texture. If you prefer soft, just cook it to hard then dip it in milk. There's the whole salmonella thing from eating raw or undercooked dough. Ew! No thanks... Anyway, try it out and enjoy!
